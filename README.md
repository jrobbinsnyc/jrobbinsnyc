- 👋 Hi, I’m @jrobbinsnyc
- 👀 I’ve got more interests than your average bear...If it can be created by hand, I'm all in!  I've been up to my elbows in acrylic paint while enjoying a 12-week program in abstract painting, and I make most of my own clothes (and draft the patterns for them too). While I've tried my hand at shoemaking, it's on the back-burner for a while as I concentrate on painting... and finding a new job! My previous (wonderful) position at Saks Fifth Avenue (Hudson's Bay Company) was, sadly, eliminated due to COVID.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new skills through Google's Data Analytics Certificate course. I never tire of learning new things. I also enjoy creating websites for non-profit organizations with Wordpress.org, creating child-themes, and all the fun that goes with that!  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...anything fun or interesting! 
- 📫 How to reach me ...jennyrobbinsNYC@gmail.com
